# AwareBot
AwareBot is website and android application. It is used to give updates to students directly from teachers in their hands anytime, anywhere. Here, when teacher’s login takes place
successfully he/she is directed to activity to enter some data about lectures, notices and so on. When students get logged into the system they can see the posts posted by their corresponding
teachers. By this mechanism both teachers and students save lot of time and efforts. For logging in, we provide permissions to teachers to assign different passwords for different classes. If students do not have android, then they can use our website to see posts. This website is developed for apple iPhone or desktop users. To implement this, we have used realtime database which allows to store and retrieve data in milliseconds. This makes our system more responsive and reliable.
In previous systems, we used to create timetable of college lectures. Students have to see it every time to know time of lectures. Also, some lectures of them were not conducted
every day. It used to waste lot of time of students. Also, in previous systems, only notice boards were used to share important notices with students. Students miss many notices of them and that
becomes problematic for teachers or college staff.
In our application, this problem is overcome. Students are able to see their upcoming lectures and practicals every day. Problem of off-lectures will not occur. It will save students’
time. And teachers are also allowed to share important notices anytime. So, notices will deliver to each student. Sometimes, WhatsApp groups were used to inform students by teachers about lectures, notices and checking/ submission alerts. Students did lot of discussions about that topic. It used
to create miscommunication. In our system, only teachers are granted to update information and alerts. Students don’t have permission to reply on anything. It makes system more reliable.
